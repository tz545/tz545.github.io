My name is Tiantian Zheng, and I am a scientist turned data scientist. I graduated with a PhD in Computational Biological Physics from the University of Toronto, during which I developed a strong interest in machine learning, especially applied to biological systems. Since my PhD, I have been working as a Data Scientist at Veeva Systems, where I apply machine learning to identify patients with unmet treatment needs and uncover physicial referral networks to help clients in the life sciences industry engage with the correct health care providers and health care organizations. 

Here you can find all my [personal projects](https://tz545.github.io/portfolio/) and [publications](https://tz545.github.io/publications/).
