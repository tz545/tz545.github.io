The separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells necessitates large-volume molecular transport between the two compartments, which is facilitated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The interior of an NPC is typically highly crowded with many simultaneously translocating cargo-carrying transport proteins. How nucleocytoplasmic transport can remain rapid, efficient, and selective under such crowded conditions without clogging remains puzzling. We show how the unique internal architecture of the NPC engenders clogging-relieving mechanisms that -- counterintuitively -â€” harness crowding toward faster and more efficient transport. These results explain long-standing puzzles, shed light on the regulation of transport crowding by the NPC, and suggest design principles for the optimization of artificial selective nanochannels inspired by the NPC.
